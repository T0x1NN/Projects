SHOULDER SURFING PREVENTION SYSTEM AND AUTHENTICATION TECHNIQUES



Abstract:

Due to rise in internet users and online dependencies, the risk of sensitive
data being leaked is increasing day by day. For example, online transactions, online shopping, online registrations, online education, work from home, excessive use of social media etc. Security and privacy are playing vital role in any online application and to access or share any Information, the user requires a password. Therefore, to maintain password security and privacy, user uses different types of authentication technique one of them is a textual password. Main concept of all this is to maintain Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

Shoulder surfing is an attack which is used to obtain confidential information such as personal identification numbers, passwords and login credentials by looking over the victim’s shoulder. The objective of our project is to prevent others from direct observation of our confidential details. The correctly entered password appears to be random and can only be derived with the knowledge of the full set of password objects or by uploading a secret image file as an authentication factor.
